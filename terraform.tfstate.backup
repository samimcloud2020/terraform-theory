Filename which will keep infrastructure state can be set using the -state and a backup file name â€“ with the-backup.
By default, a backup of your state file is written to terraform.tfstate.backup in case the state file is lost or corrupted to simplify recovery.
The state file is used by Terraform to keep track of resources and metadata information about your infrastructure. By default, the state of your environment
is stored locally in your Terraform workspace directory in a file called terraform.tfstate along with a backup file called terraform.tfstate.backup. The state
file will not exist until you have completed at least one terraform apply.
Every time you apply Terrafrom it writes a copy of the current state of your infrastructure to a file called terraform.tfstate if this file is already present 
then it will move the old state file to a file called terraform.tfstate.backup and will create a new terraform.tfstate file.
So, When you run terraform apply then the state will be updated if changes have been made. The previous version will be saved as terraform.tfstate.backup.
